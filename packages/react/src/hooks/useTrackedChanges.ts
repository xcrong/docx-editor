 * only re-runs when PM state changes (which happens on every doc-changing
 * transaction, including remote ones via ySyncPlugin).
 *
 * No debounce: a single O(N) doc walk, cheap enough to run per transaction.
 * If you see jank on huge documents, wrap the setter that drives the state
 * argument in `requestAnimationFrame` rather than reintroducing a delay here —
 * a delay makes the sidebar feel laggy.
